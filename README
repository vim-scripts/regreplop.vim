This plugin provides an operator to replace something(motion/visual) with a
specified register.
By default, the operator is mapped at
  <Plug>ReplaceMotion  " for normal mode
  <Plug>ReplaceLine    " for normal mode (replace a line)
  <Plug>ReplaceVisual  " for visual mode
and if there are no key mappings for <C-K>, <C-K> is mapped to these
operators. (and <C-K><C-K> for ReplaceLine)

If you want to map them to other keys, add the lines below in your vimrc.
  nmap YOURKEY <Plug>ReplaceMotion
  nmap YOURKEY <Plug>ReplaceLine
  vmap YOURKEY <Plug>ReplaceVisual

Examples:
  in normal mode:
     <C-K>iw     " replace inner word with default register
     "a<C-K>iw   " replace inner word with register a
     <C-K>$      " replace whole text to right of the cursor
     <C-K><C-K>  " replaces the line under the cursor

  in visual mode:
     <C-K>       " replace visual selection with default register
     "a<C-K>     " replace visual selection with register a

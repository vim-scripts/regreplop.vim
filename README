This plugin provides a operator to replace something(motion/visual) with a
specified register.
By default, the operator is mapped at
  <Plug>ReplaceMotion  " for normal mode
  <Plug>ReplaceLine    " for normal mode (replace a line)
  <Plug>ReplaceVisual  " for visual mode
and if there are no key mapping for <C-K>, <C-K> is mapped to these
operators. (and <C-K><C-K> for ReplaceLine)

If you want to map them to another keys, add like below in your vimrc.
  nmap YOURKEY <Plug>ReplaceMotion
  nmap YOURKEY <Plug>ReplaceLine
  vmap YOURKEY <Plug>ReplaceVisual

     "a<C-K>iw   " replace inner word with register a
